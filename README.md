# DIY Data Challenge

A spur-of-the-moment creation and execution of a practice data challenge

## Notes

I was asked by a colleague where to find good SQL practice problems.  I
suggested downloading an interesting but complex dataset and creating a local
SQL compatible database on which to practice joins, aggregate function, CTE's
and the like.  Later the same day, I was asked for some examples of code or
data science project that I had done in the past.  Because I had nothing in my
github related to my past work as a data scientist, I thought I would take my
own advice and find some interesting data to import then think up my own data
challenge in the vein of others I've completed in the past.  The notebook in
this repo is the result of that thought.  

Importantly, I don't know anything about birds, so the dataset I chose was
completely foreign to me, as datasets from data challenges often are.  I
created the database from the data described and thought up the three
questions for the challenge on a Friday afternoon and completed the challenge
in about 6 hours the following Monday.  Thus, I think the tasks presented are
a fair approximation of "real-life" data challenges and my "solution" closely
resembles my submissions from past challenges in terms of code, comments,
visualizations, and though process.

If helpful to you in any way, you're welcome.  If nothing else, you might
learn something about birds.
